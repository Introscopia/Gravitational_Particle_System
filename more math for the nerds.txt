That's right, if you still haven't had enough math, here some more! 

  // here I'm calculating the total kinetic energy of the system.
  // we can observe the inelastic colitions decreasing the total energy
  // as we would predict,
  // but the gravity injects more into the system. I think this is acceptable
  // in a simulation at a local level, but you should really ask a physicist.
	
  float K = 0; 
  for(int i = 0; i < PS.size(); ++i){
    K += 0.5 * PI * sq(PS.get(i).R) * sq( PS.get(i).vel.mag() );
  }
  println( K );
  
  // And this is to monitor the conservation of "mass" (area)
  // (Spoiler) it works!
  float M = 0; 
  for(int i = 0; i < PS.size(); ++i){
    M += PS.get(i).area();
  }
  println( M );
