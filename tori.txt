This creates a toroidal topology,
hence the name of the method and variables I used to accomplish this.
A torus is a doughnut shape, we say that these top-bottom and right-left
"warps" form a toroidal topology because 
the only way to take a piece of paper and fold it such that 
it actually connects those edges in that way 
is to make a doughnut shape with it.
